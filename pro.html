            <b> Recognition enables computers, applications and software to comprehend and translate human speech data into text, for business solutions. The speech recognition model works by using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse your voice and language, identify by learning the words you are saying, and then output those words with transcription accuracy as model content or text data on a screen.</b>

        <p style="color: black;">
            <b> Recognition or voice recognition is a complex process that involves audio accuracy over several steps and data or language solutions, including:</b>
        </p>
        <li style="color: black;"><b>Recognizing the words, models and content in the user’s speech or audio. This business accuracy step requires training the model to identify each word in your vocabulary or audio cloud.</b></li>
        <li style="color: black;"><b>Converting those audios and language into text. This step involves converting recognized audios into letters or numbers (called phonemes) so that other parts of the AI software solutions system can process those models.</b></li>
        <li style="color: black;"><b>Determining what was said. Next, AI looks at which content and words were spoken most often and how frequently they were used together to determine their meaning (this process is known as “predictive modelling”).</b></li>
